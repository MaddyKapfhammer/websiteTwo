## Allegheny Mozilla Fellows

I work with Allegheny College's Computer Science Department on the Allegheny Ethical CS initiative team. Funded by the [Mozilla Responsible CS Challenge](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/responsible-cs/) this group of students and professors, also know as the Allegheny Mozilla Fellows strive to integrate ethical computer science practices into its curriculum.

## The Creation of Vigor

Over the summer of 2020, I began working in collaboration with Dr. Jumadinova, from Allegheny's computer science department to create a tool that deals with the ethics of big data usage. Through investigation of health data, such as those from FitBits, Apple watches, and fitness tracking applications, `Vigor` was born.

## About Vigor's Software

`Vigor` is a tool that combines classification algorithms, data generation and predictive analytics to determine the risk that an individual has for health such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. This tool is designed to take in information about a person, including age and physical activity level to generate daily steps taken, heart rate, blood pressure and even more vital signs. `Vigor` also combines querying the NIH's PubMed database, to determine severity of health risks. Along with predictive wellness, `Vigor` holds capabilies for data generation for data analytics courses, and customized PubMed querying.

## Connection to Ethics

`Vigor` was created specifically to help secondary institutions to incoorporate ethics into their computer science departments. This tool allows students to understand the information that can be gathered through fitness data, and have candid conversations about ethical practices in the field of computer science. Along with aiding conversations about ethical programming practices, this tool also serves as a glipse into classification algorithms to be used in artificial intelligence courses, and data generation for data analytics and bioinformatics courses at Allegheny College.
