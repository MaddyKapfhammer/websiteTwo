# A Glimpse Into What I've Been Reading

When I younger, I spent _hours_ of my life begging my parents to buy me new books to read. My interests ranged from biographies to science fiction. Honestly, I would read anything that you put in my hands. As I have grown into the 20 year old that I am, of course my interests have shifted and changed, however I still do **love** to read. Ufortunately, being a full-time college student takes away most of my time to get lost in a novel, and I spend my evenings reading textbooks. Nevertheless, here are the things I've been reading over the past few months!

## Current Read: Becoming by Michelle Obama

I've only made it to page 10, so nothing to report so far, but I have heard **amazing things**!
