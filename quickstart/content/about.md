# You Can Call Me Maddy

Hello! It's great to meet you! My name is Madelyn Kapfhammer, but _please_ call me Maddy (most of my friends do). I am a junior at [Allegheny College](https://allegheny.edu/) double majoring in **biology** and **computer science** and minoring in **global health studies**. Yes, it is an interesting and difficult combination, but I have a unique passion for all of these fields and am so excited to continue my journey into the fields of **bioinformatics** and **data analytics**. Along with being a student, I am a daughter to Jessica and Gregory Kapfhammer, contant comment tea _lover_, _avid_ Spotify user, _big_ reader, sincere friend, and foodie _extraordinaire_! At Allegheny, I am a Technical Leader (TL) and Software Engineer for the Computer Science Department, Mozilla Fellow, and big fan of the classic brick streets. With my combination of biology and computer science, I am excited to pursue a career in bioinformatics or data analytics. Since high school I have been immensely interested in microbiology, genetics, and since attending college, I have developed a curosity for software development and predictive analytics. I hope to find a unique combination of all of these interests in the future, most likely through graduate school. I spend most of my time studying (my academic performance is very important to me!) but when you can't find me at my desk, I'm ususally spending time with my family, friends, and dog Bosco.
