# Podcasts are basically taking the world by storm

A year ago if someone would have asked me what I knew about podcasts it probably would have gone something like this...

    Friendly stranger: Hey! Listening to any good podcasts recently?

    Me: Podcasts? You mean those boring things my dad listens to while he washes the dishes? No way!

    Friendly stranger: *gently nodds head and walks away*

Unfortunately, I **didn't know** what I was missing. I remember making fun of my dad for listening to podcasts when I was younger. I always associated them with boring men talking about the news. Thankfully, I finally have discovered the world of _actually ineresting_ podcasts, it only took **twenty years**

Since discovering the world of science, true crime, and casual conversation podcasts, there are a few that I listen to habitually _every week_.

## Some of my favorites are:

#### The Life Scientific

#### Pretty Basic with Alisha Maria and Remi Cruz
