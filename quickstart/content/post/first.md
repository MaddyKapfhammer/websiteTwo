So yes, it did only take me two full years to actually create a fully functioning website. To be honest, I should have done it a long time ago, but oh well. I've grown a lot since second semester, it's probably for the best that I came to my senses and discarded the netlify template that looked too much like that of a travel blogger... I am not a travel blogger.
